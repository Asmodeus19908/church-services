# Church Services Project

Church Services is a web-based platform developed for Pamukid Presbyterian Church, designed to modernize member access and management of church-related services. This system allows users such as members, admins securely log in, access church services, and manage their participation in events, schedules, and more.

After logging in, users are welcomed with a personalized greeting screen showing the church logo, name, and a message of encouragement.
